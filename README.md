# Aquarium 2

Aquarium 2 is an interactive 3D simulation game built using Three.js, where users can observe and interact with a virtual aquarium environment.

## Features

- **Realistic 3D Environment**: Experience a lifelike aquarium with dynamic lighting and water effects.
- **Fish Simulation**: Watch as fish swim around the tank, exhibiting natural behaviors and interactions.
- **Interactive Controls**: Use your mouse or touch to interact with the environment and observe fish behavior.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aquarium2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```
   cd aquarium2
   ```
3. **Open the Application**:
   - Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- **Start the Simulation**: The simulation starts automatically upon opening the application.
- **Interact with Fish**: Click and drag to rotate the view, and use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
- **Observe Fish Behavior**: Watch as fish swim and interact with each other. Improvements are ongoing to enhance fish appearance and behavior.

## Known Issues

- **Fish Appearance**: Current fish models may not closely resemble real fish. Enhancements are in progress to improve their visual fidelity.
- **Chasing Behavior**: Fish do not yet exhibit realistic chasing behavior. This feature is under development to create more lifelike interactions.
