# Aquarium 2

Aquarium 2 is an interactive 3D aquarium simulation game built using Three.js. Dive into a vibrant underwater world where you can observe detailed pixel art fish swimming in a beautifully crafted environment.

## Features

- **Dynamic Fish Movement**: Watch as fish swim around the aquarium, exploring their environment with realistic movement patterns.
- **Detailed Pixel Art**: Enjoy high-quality pixel graphics that bring each fish and the underwater environment to life.
- **Immersive Environment**: Experience a fully-rendered 3D aquarium with dynamic lighting and realistic water effects.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aquarium2.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd aquarium2
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to start the application.

## Usage

- Launch the application by opening `index.html`.
- Observe the fish as they swim around the aquarium.
- Use your mouse to interact with the environment and explore different perspectives.

## Known Issues

- Fish may occasionally leave the visible area of the aquarium. We are working on improving boundary detection to keep them within view.
- Performance may vary depending on your device's capabilities, especially with detailed pixel graphics.

## Future Improvements

- Implement boundary constraints to ensure fish remain visible within the aquarium.
- Enhance the pixel art detail for both fish and the environment.
- Add more fish species and interactive elements to enrich the user experience.
