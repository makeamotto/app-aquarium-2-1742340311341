# Aquarium 2

Aquarium 2 is an interactive 3D simulation game built using Three.js, where users can observe and interact with a virtual aquarium environment.

## Features

- **3D Aquarium Environment**: Experience a realistic underwater world with dynamic lighting and textures.
- **Fish Simulation**: Watch as fish swim around the aquarium, exhibiting natural behaviors.
- **Interactive Controls**: Use your mouse or touch to interact with the environment and observe fish behavior.

## Current Issues

- **Fish Appearance**: The fish models need improvement to look more realistic.
- **Fish Behavior**: Fish do not properly chase each other, requiring enhancements in their movement algorithms.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aquarium2.git
