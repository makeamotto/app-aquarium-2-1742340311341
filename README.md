# Aquarium 2

Aquarium 2 is an interactive 3D simulation game built using Three.js, where users can observe and interact with a virtual aquarium environment.

## Features

- **Realistic 3D Environment**: Experience a lifelike aquarium with dynamic lighting and water effects.
- **Fish Simulation**: Watch as fish swim around the tank, exhibiting natural behaviors and interactions.
- **Interactive Controls**: Use your mouse or touch to interact with the environment and observe fish behavior.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aquarium2.git

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the Application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- **Start the Simulation**: Upon opening the application, the aquarium simulation will start automatically.
- **Interact with Fish**: Click and drag to rotate the view, and use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
- **Observe Fish Behavior**: Watch as fish swim and interact with each other. Note: Improvements are ongoing to enhance fish appearance and behavior.

## Known Issues
