# Aquarium Simulator

Aquarium Simulator is an interactive 3D game built using Three.js, where you can observe a virtual aquarium ecosystem. In this simulator, fish swim around, eat each other, and grow bigger, providing a dynamic and engaging experience.

## Features

- **Realistic 3D Environment**: Experience a beautifully rendered aquarium with realistic water effects and lighting.
- **Dynamic Fish Behavior**: Fish move autonomously, seeking out smaller fish to eat and grow larger.
- **Growth Mechanics**: As fish consume others, they increase in size, altering the balance of the ecosystem.
- **Interactive Controls**: Navigate the aquarium and observe the fish from different angles using intuitive controls.
