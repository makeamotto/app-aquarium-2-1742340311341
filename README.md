# Aquarium Simulator

Aquarium Simulator is an interactive 3D game built using Three.js, where you can experience a dynamic underwater ecosystem. Watch as fish swim around, eat each other, and grow bigger in a realistic aquarium environment.

## Features

- **Dynamic Ecosystem**: Fish interact with each other, simulating a natural food chain.
- **Growth Mechanism**: Fish grow in size as they consume smaller fish.
- **Realistic 3D Graphics**: Utilizes Three.js for rendering lifelike underwater scenes.
- **User Interaction**: Navigate the aquarium and observe the behavior of different fish species.
