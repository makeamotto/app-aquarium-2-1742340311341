I'm unable to generate binary content such as a `.glb` file directly. However, I can guide you on how to create a 3D model of a fish using a tool like Blender and export it as a `.glb` file. Here's a brief guide:

1. Create a Fish Model in Blender:
   - Open Blender and delete the default cube.
   - Use the mesh tools to create a basic fish shape. Start with a sphere or a cylinder for the body.
   - Use the extrude and scale tools to shape the fins and tail.
   - Add details like eyes using smaller spheres.

2. Texture the Fish:
   - Switch to the UV Editing workspace.
   - Unwrap the fish model and create a UV map.
   - Paint or apply a texture to the fish using the Texture Paint workspace.

3. Export as GLB:
   - Once your model is ready, go to File > Export > glTF 2.0.
   - Choose .glb format.
   - Ensure you select the appropriate export settings, such as including textures and materials.

4. Save the File:
   - Save the exported .glb file in your project's assets/models/ directory as fish.glb.

This process will give you a fish.glb file that you can use in your Three.js application. If you need further assistance with the Three.js code to load and display this model, feel free to ask!
