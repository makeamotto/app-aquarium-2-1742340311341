I'm unable to generate or provide actual image files, including JPEGs. However, I can guide you on how to create or obtain a water texture image for your aquarium simulator. You can create a water texture using graphic design software like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, or you can find free water texture images on websites like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay. Once you have your image, save it as `water.jpg` in the `assets/textures/` directory of your project.
