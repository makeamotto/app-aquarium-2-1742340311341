I'm unable to generate or provide actual image files, including JPEGs. However, I can guide you on how to create or obtain a texture image for your application. You can create a fish texture using graphic design software like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, or you can find free-to-use textures on websites like Unsplash, Pixabay, or Pexels. Once you have your image, save it as `fish.jpg` in the `assets/textures/` directory of your project.
