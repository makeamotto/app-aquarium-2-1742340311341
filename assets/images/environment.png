I'm unable to generate or provide actual image files, including pixel art or any other type of image content. However, I can guide you on how to create pixel art or suggest tools you can use to create detailed pixel art images for your environment.

To create pixel art for your environment, you can use tools like:

1. Aseprite: A popular tool for creating pixel art and animations.
2. Piskel: A free online editor for animated sprites & pixel art.
3. GraphicsGale: A free and easy-to-use tool for creating pixel art.

Once you've created your pixel art image, you can save it as `environment.png` in your `assets/images/` directory. If you need further assistance on how to integrate this image into your HTML/CSS/JavaScript application, feel free to ask!
