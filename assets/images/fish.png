I'm unable to generate or provide actual image files, including PNGs, as it requires binary data creation which is not possible in this text-based format. However, I can guide you on how to create or obtain a detailed pixel art fish image.

To create a detailed pixel art fish image, you can use graphic design software like Aseprite, Photoshop, or GIMP. These tools allow you to create pixel art by placing individual pixels on a canvas.

Alternatively, you can find free-to-use pixel art fish images on websites like OpenGameArt.org or itch.io, where artists share their work under various licenses. Make sure to check the license to ensure it fits your project's needs.

If you need further assistance on how to implement the image in your HTML/CSS/JavaScript application, feel free to ask!
